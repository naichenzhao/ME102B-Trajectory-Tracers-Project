# ME102B Project: Trajectory Tracers

This is the code used for our Sp23 ME102B Final Project.

Group 20 - Trajectory Tracers



## Project Description

The goal of the project was to create a machine that would predict how a ball would fall down a ramp, and then move a cup to catch it.

The code included here includes the software run through python on the main computer, as well as the software run on an ESP32 used to control the stepper motor.
